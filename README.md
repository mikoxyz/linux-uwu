# linux-uwu

linux-uwu is an optimized low-latency kernel based on the Debian Linux sources. It uses a few patches, including graysky2's gcc optimization patch, Gabriel Krisman's fsync patch, and a few CLR patches, which all should add up into a kernel that should be faster than the vanilla kernel.

Note: linux-uwu has only been tested on Debian sid on amd64, so I can't guarantee that it'll work and/or compile on other distributions and/or other architectures.
